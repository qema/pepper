Pepper
======

Pepper is an in-development 2D iPhone game engine using all the cool new iOS technologies like OpenGL ES 2.0 and GLKit. Oh, and it's ARC-enabled, unlike cocos2d. Pepper is based off a console-style architecture, meaning the game scene is based on tile layers and sprite layers; no scene graph nonsense. It's pretty cool.
